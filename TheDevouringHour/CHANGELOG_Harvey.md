#### \- Summary -

Fixed tutorial camera switching.

* Will continue on the tutorial.


Harvey Wheeler - 8/26

Implemented dialogue system into the phone.

* Dialogue now begins when answering a phone call.
* Edited Dialogue\_data to include a new trigger: "ChangeGameState"

Restructured/Renamed all files for clarity. Removed some redundant files.

* Reorganized assets/folders to group like with like.
* Removed all but one interaction Blueprint Interface.
* Updated the phone and light switch to use the same interaction blueprint interface, with an interaction prompt and everything.



##### \- Bugs -

##### \- Additional Notes -

* I wasn't entirely sure which assets were made by who, so I avoided adding name suffixes at this point. Should be able to add them without issue in the future. It would be great if you all could rename them yourselves maybe? :)
* Please let me know if I need to change anything for better clarity, I was kinda just freeballing it.

### Jaqlyn Crow - 4/28

##### 

##### \- Summary -

This is the first Changelog for our in house team. I expect everyone to add a section to this file before pushing your changes to the repository.



Please be as detailed as possible to give your teammates the best chance of utilizing this information.



Please include 4 sections, a brief summary of what you changed and your intentions, a list of the exact changes in more detail, any unresolved bugs you encountered, and any additional notes or requests you may have at the bottom.



I will set the standard for what I expect to see below with my changes as of 4/28.



##### \- Changes Made -

* Added a sixth spotlight to the Laboratory. Updated both blueprints that care about the spotlights to include it.
* Moved the sixth light to better illuminate the Generator, i.e. slightly closer to the center of the room. Is not final placement.
* Disabled certain rendering features including Ambient Occlusion and Auto Exposure, as they don't fit the style of our game.
* ###### **Modified the Generator Blueprint**

  * Added a variable for whether the Lever is Flipped up or down
  * Modified timer related variables to Read more in line with actual functionality (Default and Current Energy Level Respectively)
  * Modified the timer system to tick up when the lever is flipped up and tick down when the lever is flipped down
  * Changed Blackouts to occur when the timer reaches 20 (it's max) in addition to 0.

    * Generater checks after incrementing the energy level if the level is between 1 and 19. If not, the Blackout will occur.
  * **NOTE** : *There is currently no functionality to flip the lever up and change the lever state to active. Pressing E on the lever still just resets the value to 0 and now causes a Blackout.*

    * Fixed this!! Flip Functionality Works now!
    * Clicking on the generator will only call the reset the generator if the power is failing.
    * The Countdown now checks to see what the Lever State is before deciding whether to increment to Energy Level up or down.

##### 

##### \- Bugs -

* I can't pick up the phone, please investigate.



##### \- Additional Notes -

Please refer to the Modeling Notes Document in regards to the changes needed to finish implementing what I worked on today.

\## Changes Made (02/18/2026)

\- Added new BluePrint Actor 'BP\_PickupableBase'

&#x20; - The base is a duplicate of 'BP\_InteractableBase', is detected by the first person character in the same way

&#x20;- Created new function 'UpdateHeldItem' in BP\_FirstPersonCharacter

&#x20;  - This function handles setting the correct static mesh for the currently held item

\- Updated CycleInventory logic in BP\_FirstPersonCharacter EventGraph to include UpdateHeldItem when cycling

&#x20; - Cycling through the clipboard using Q and E will change the player's currently held item respective to what is displayed on the clipboard

&#x20; - ToggleInventory Logic also includes UpdateHeldItem so that held item is shown regardless of if menu is up or not

\- Added input mapping to key H to toggle currently held item visible/hidden



\## Changes Made (02/24/2026)

A skeleton dialog system that supports both linear and branching conversations. Players can interact with interactable objects (will be NPCs) and make choices that lead to different dialog paths.



\## Updates



\### 1. S\_DialogData (Structure)

Defines a single dialog entry.

\- \*\*SpeakerName\*\*: Who is speaking

\- \*\*DialogText\*\*: What they say

\- \*\*Responses\*\*: Array of player response options

\- \*\*NextDialogIndices\*\*: Array of dialog indices to jump to for each response



\### 2. WBP\_DialogBox (Widget Blueprint)

The UI that displays dialog on screen.

\- Shows speaker name and dialog text

\- Displays response buttons or continue button based on dialog type

\- Manages dialog flow and progression



\### 3. BP\_DialogueTrigger (Actor Blueprint)

Interactable actor placed in the world that starts dialog.

\- Implements BPI\_Interactable interface

\- Contains DialogSequence array with all dialog entries

\- Spawns dialog widget when player presses E



\## How It Works



\### Linear Dialog

1\. Player interacts with trigger

2\. Dialog displays with Continue button

3\. Clicking Continue advances to next dialog

4\. Ends when reaching the last entry



\### Branching Dialog

1\. Player interacts with trigger

2\. Dialog displays with 1-3 response buttons

3\. Clicking a response jumps to specified dialog index

4\. Can branch to different conversation paths

5\. Ends when reaching a dialog with no next index
